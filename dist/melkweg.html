<h1>Melkweg</h1>

<p>Melkweg is one of the best known music venues in Amsterdam, NL. They pride themselves on being at the meeting point between pop- and underground culture. Giving their audience the chance to hear new music, and expose them to artists they might otherwise not have heard is a vital part of what they do.</p>

<p>Therefore it seemed only logical exploration should take center stage on the site. The chronological agenda view takes a backseat to that which is internally dubbed ‘the discovery page’, but what visitors experience as the homepage. Since motivating visitors to explore music they might not or vaguely know is so important, listening through audio or video should never be more than a click away. Almost all events are enriched with audio snippets from Spotify or Soundcloud, or videos from Youtube.</p>

<p>Every visit should bring something new, so me and my colleagues at Grrr developed a simple but effective algorithm that allows Melkweg a degree of curation. While at the same time making sure concerts in the near future float to the top, and lesser known artists don’t get buried by the big names.</p>

<p>Of course hardcore music lovers aren’t left behind. The agenda is straightforward, and makes it easy to search for specific artists, see what club-nights are on, or keep up with just announced concerts.</p>

<p>Melkweg.nl is not about ‘disrupting’ websites of pop venues. We don’t try new things because we’re bored with the status quo. What we’re looking for is the best way to connect people to concerts that interest them, and ones they don’t even know they’re looking for. It’s a constant conversation with both the client and the audience. With small incremental updates we try to bring more focus to the parts that work, while eliminating the features that don’t.</p>

<p>The fact that after over 3 years the site isn’t bloated by unneeded features, but is actually still being improved upon is what makes this a great project for me to work on.</p>
